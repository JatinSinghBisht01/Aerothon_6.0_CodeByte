# Fly Detector Platform

The Fly Detector Platform is a web-based solution that connects aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and maintenance facilities to facilitate the early detection and diagnosis of faults in aircraft components. The platform leverages advanced analytics and machine learning to monitor aircraft health, predict potential failures, and recommend maintenance actions, thereby enhancing safety and operational efficiency in the aviation industry.

## Overview



## Key Features



## Security

- Secure Authentication: The platform implements secure authentication mechanisms, such as password hashing and salting, to protect user credentials and prevent unauthorized access. We used JWT for authentication, bcrypt for hashing and salting and express session for session management.
